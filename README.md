# yondeoku
Yondeoku is a webapp for advanced language learners. It generates custom vocab
study lists for arbitrary texts.

Yondeoku takes into account texts the you've already read and the words you've
explicitly marked as known to work out which words are new in any given text.
The webapp in development currently supports reading texts in Polish and Japanese.

Yondeoku is currently still in its development phase and is not deployed online.
The backend is written in Python using the Flask web development framework.
The frontend is written in JavaScript using Angular.
