Short Term:
- make japanese render correct sentence and mark them as read correctly
- separate out study.js into a separate polish study controller (do a directive for the polish table too)

Refactoring:
- refactor a lot of the angular stuff out to work better - esp. lots of watches, and relinking that needs to happen, maybe we can just group all the things we watch in scope variables and all the relinking functions
- stop using pickle, start using database
- change Polish code to do whole sentences
- create known lists for filtering grammatical words before they even get sent to the server

Bugs from use:
- form needs to clear last guesses
- the ability to click to link to another dictionary would be good
- the ability to replace definition with own as well (keep json cache?)
- somehow correcting your guesses - type on top?

BACK END APIs to IMPLEMENT:
⚪- get lektorek definition for list of words
⚪- get lektorek definition for single word
Model first passing down:
	⚪️- keep as jsonpickle for now is fine, will change eventually
Model State changes:
	User:
		⚪- add block
		⚪- delete block
		⚪- add word to known word list
		⚪- remove word from known word list
		⚪- update threshold value
	Block:
		⚪- mark token range as read
		⚪- mark token range as unread

FRONT END APIs to IMPLEMENT:
Things that sync to model:
	⚪- add word to known word list
		- keep back end in sync
	⚪- remove word from known word list
		- keep back end in sync
	⚪- add block
		- keep back end in sync
	⚪- remove block
		- keep back end in sync
	⚪- mark token range as read
		- keep back end in sync
	⚪- mark token range as unread
		- keep back end in sync
	⚪- update threshold value
		- keep back end in sync
Studying Functions:
⚪- instantiate a service variable which gets a dict of readLemmas
⚪- find out if a word is a 'new word' isNew
	⚪- takes a lemma
	⚪- if it is in the known list, it is not new
	⚪- if it is in the readLemmaDict (see above) and above threshold, it is not new
	⚪- otherwise it is new
- getting next text blob from the current Block (keep track of where it's got to so far)
- get currently reading section
	- if currently empty
		- get greatest number of full sentences which don't exceed X new words
			- get text blob up to next 'break point'
			vocabList = []
			blob = getNextBlob(text)
			for lemma in blob:
				if isNew(lemma):
					vocabList.append(lemma)
			- continue iterating like this until the vocab list exceeds the desired number of words, then discard the final iteration
- post words from list to get their definitions from the backend Lektorek route (learning view)
Reading functions:
- post a single word to get definition from the backend Lektorek route (reading view)
- post to mark section as read

	- the function is also to be called whenever user marks words as known
		- needs to be able to update the current reading section value without ruining user input (probably fine)



Main UI Flow:
- select Block to start reading
- renders list of next ~10 lemmas w/out definitions
	- user can click any to say definitely known
		- pulls in new words if room
	- textboxes by all words for user to type their guesses in
		- click submit
	- displays actual definitions alongside user's guesses
		- tick each off to say studied
		- click submit and read
- displays text section
	- hovering over a word should allow clicking to get reminder
	- button to mark as read and read more



FUTURE-PROOFING:
- keep read dates for readtokens
- keep generated vocab lists, with section they were for, and start and end times -> later could calculate no. new words learnt and how much read in how long and graphs, etc.

PRIORITIES:
- check what's happening with the lemmatizer and comparative/superlative forms, may need to find a workaroud to the lektorek correct definition finder bit which allows szy/naj at the start and end and it still being the same
- check how lektorek deals with pronoun forms, possessive adj and prepositions and conjuctions add a list of these to the known words if necessary, maybe also a list of all numbers


Ideas for features:
	- sorting the list of studying words alphabetically
