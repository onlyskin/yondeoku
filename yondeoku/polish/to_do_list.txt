PRIORITIES:
- modify vocab list route pass down the defintions with the results
- check what's happening with the lemmatizer and comparative/superlative forms, may need to find a workaroud to the lektorek correct definition finder bit which allows szy/naj at the start and end and it still being the same
- add a way to easily mark in the UI when a word is definitely known
- check how lektorek deals with pronoun forms, possessive adj and prepositions and conjuctions add a list of these to the known words if necessary, maybe also a list of all numbers


To be usable:
- implement seen threshold on User
	- User.makeVocabList takes this into account
- change caching so it catches the whole json each time
- get vocab list route passing down definitions -> somehow asynchronously so it doesn't block ones loading??
- UI:
	- selecting the section to read next -> calls to API to get known and learning
	- allow toggling between known/learning
		- make calls to API to change User's known lemmas list
	- render vocab list for that section for prestudy
	- button to mark section as read
